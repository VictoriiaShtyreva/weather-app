### Stacks technology which I used:
- :white_check_mark: HTML
- :white_check_mark: SASS
- :white_check_mark: Responsible (Mobile First Approach)
- :white_check_mark: JS
- :white_check_mark: Gulp: 
    - independently converts and connects fonts, and also writes the connection to a style file;
    - works with CSS preprocessors like SASS(SCSS) and optimizes them; 
    - combines several JavaScript files into one using WEBPACK, optimizes and compresses them.
